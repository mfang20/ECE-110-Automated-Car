# ECE-110-Automated-Car

Hi, this is Matthew. Here is the outline of my design process for creating an automated car which follows a light source and halts and reverses when a barrier is presented in
front of it. Looking back this combination of functionality doesn't really have much real world application but, this was a very good opportunity to explore various sensors like 
photocells, and ultrasonic distance sensors, as well as other electrical devices including H-bridges and MOSfets.
